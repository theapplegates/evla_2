## Getting Started

Make a directory and navigate to it:

```
mkdir my-site-name
cd my-site-name
```

Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/scottsweb/elva.git .
```

Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Run Eleventy for site development. View the site at `http://localhost:8080`:

```
npm run dev
```

Generate a production-ready build to the `dist` folder:

```
npm run build
```

To use [Front Matter CMS](https://frontmatter.codes/), install [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and enable the extension (if it doesn't enable automatically). It will open each time you launch your project.

## Personalisation Checklist

- [ ] At the top of `.eleventy.js` you'll see some dynamic settings for `url`, `isProduction` and `isStaging`. Make sure these environment variables are set in staging and production and tweak as necessary
- [ ] Configure your sites settings in `/src/_data/settings.json` or in Front Matter CMS (under Data)
- [ ] Add your chosen languages ([the demo site will soon guide you through this](https://elva.scott.ee/en/writing/adding-additional-languages/))
- [ ] Configure your sites navigation in `/src/_data/navigation.js`
- [ ] Set your own default images, icons and favicon by replacing the images in `/src/assets/img/` 
- [ ] Add your content — it's easiest to do this with Front Matter CMS which exposes [all front matter](https://elva.scott.ee/en/writing/frontmatter/) in the UI
- [ ] Setup a custom template for your open graph images (`.frontmatter/scripts/opengraph-template.html`)
- [ ] Design your site by customising the CSS (`/src/assets/css/`), layouts (`/src/_layouts/`) and includes (`/src/_includes/`)

### Optional

- [ ] Set your preferred image sizes and formats in the image shortcode `/src/_config/shortcodes/image.js`
- [ ] If you add more front matter, you may wish to edit `frontmatter.json` to add [Front Matter CMS](https://frontmatter.codes/) support
- [ ] You many not need [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/) which can be removed from `/src/assets/js/bundle.njk`
- [ ] Use [Eleventy Fetch](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/fetch/) to grab some API data
- [ ] If you enable Photon CDN support [familiarise yourself with these limitations](https://jetpack.com/support/site-accelerator/#limitations)
